# Style Components
This folder is meant to contain the pre-styled elements to replace React-Bootstrap with our own custom elements that do more of what we want them to do, rather than relying on an overly-complicated and incomplete external library. 

Initially this was meant for Bootstrap-only styles, but with discussion up about the potential change to another UI library this was renamed to be a bit more flexible.
